This repository contains my Postman Collection for performing CRUD operations using https://api.restful-api.dev/.

## Tasks Covered
1. Used all API methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
2. Set Base URL as variable
3. Generated random request body data
4. Parsed JSON response and logged values
5. Wrote Chai assertions (including a failing test)
6. Used Pre-request and Tests sections for variable handling
7. Chained APIs using response variables

## How to Use
1. Import the JSON file into Postman.
2. Check the environment variables (`baseUrl`, `createdId`, etc.).
3. Run each request step by step.
